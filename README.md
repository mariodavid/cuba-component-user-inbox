          repositories {
            maven {
              url  "https://dl.bintray.com/mariodavid/cuba-components"
            }
          }

Add custom application component to your project:

* Artifact group: `de.diedavids.cuba.userinbox`
* Artifact name: `user-inbox-global`
* Version: *add-on version*

```groovy
dependencies {
  appComponent("de.diedavids.cuba.dataimport:dataimport-global:*addon-version*")
}
```


## Using the inbox as a user

As a logged in user you'll see a menu entry called "Messages" which will show the incoming messages that are either
from another user of the system or from the system itself, which has send a message
to the system in order to notify the user about something changed in the system.

## Sending messages

To send messages to a particular user, there are two options available:

* manually sending message to a user
* system messages that are send programmatically


### Send manual messages

In order to send a message to a particular user, there is a button "Send message" in the users inbox.

This screen allows to manually send a message. A message contains a subject and a body, just like a regular Email.

This feature can sometimes be helpful but oftentimes sending a regular email is not worse.

##### Context-based messages

Therefore there is another option to send a Message. In this case it is a message that is send through the context of a particular entity.

This is comparable of sending a email with a link that points to a particular customer / order etc. in your application together with the information from the sender.


### Send system messages (programmatically)

The other way to send a message to a user is that the developer defines points in the application, where it is useful to notify some user
about a particular thing happend. This can be various actions, like:

* a new Customer has been created
* an order was placed with a total amount > 10k
* an import of data through an API was successful
* ...

There are lot of things that might happen in the lifecycle of an application that are worth to notify.

To send a message to user programmatically, there is a [MessageService]() which will allow exactly this. The interface of this service
looks liks this:

````
public interface MessageService {

    void sendSystemMessage(User receiver, String subject, String messageText);
    
    void sendSystemMessage(User receiver, String subject, String messageText, Entity entityReference);

}
````

`sendSystemMessage` will add a message in the given receivers inbox with a subject, a text and an optional entity reference.


## Using predefined main window screens

This application component comes with two options for the main screens, that can be used in the final application.
 
* SideMainwindowWithMessages (side-mainwindow-with-messages.xml)
* AppMainWindowWithMessages (mainwindow-with-messages.xml)

One of these two classes can be used as the mainwinow through the following definition in your web-screens.xml:

````    
<!-- either the normal mainwindow with messages badge -->
<screen id="mainWindow"
        template="de/diedavids/cuba/userinbox/web/screens/mainwindow-with-messages.xml"/>

<!-- or the side menu main window with messages badge -->
<screen id="mainWindow"
        template="de/diedavids/cuba/userinbox/web/screens/side-mainwindow-with-messages.xml"/>

````

You can also extend this screens, so that you can add your own (screen-) logic to the mainwindow.
