### Change
- BREAKING: Storage format for message record references has been changed. In order to migrate to the new storage format
you have to download `etc/migrate-message-records-to-new-format.zip` from this repository and run it in the [Diagnose Wizard](https://github.com/mariodavid/cuba-component-runtime-diagnose/tree/de284e5cbce19bb02260b59b9dcd133f2729b0e3#diagnose-wizard).
For that to work you have to temporarily add the [runtime-diagnose](https://github.com/mariodavid/cuba-component-runtime-diagnose) app-component to your application.
This script has to run once, will do the migration. After that, the app component can be removed again.
